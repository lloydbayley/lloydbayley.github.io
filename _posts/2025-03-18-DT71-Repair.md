Recently, I noticed that my Miniware/Morning Tools DT71 Test Tweezers were losing battery rather quickly after a full charge.
I did some testing and opened it up to test the batteries and BOY was it was the batteries!
There are two batteries, one in each leg.
One of them was swollen, so it's a good thing I found it.

There are a lot of instructions online about cutting a small piece of the leg out to reveal the battery terminals for soldering/desoldering.

However, before I tried this, I unscrewed the tip of the tweezers, popped the little piece of plastic off that aligns the legs upon closing and put a flat-bladed screwdriver there and successfully prised the inner cover off. If you like, you can also take the two screws out at the top of either leg to allow for better manipulation.

It seems to have caused the cover to become loose and perhaps it was glued and could be again perhaps using some hot glue that would dissolve with alcohol the next time (if there is one) that the batteries need replacing.

Once all that covers were off and the good stuff was exposed, I could easily de-solder the old batteries and replace with the new ones.

You can see the size difference between the two but the rating is the same and so-far, the batteries are behaving like good 'uns.

The batteries installed ok and you just need to place them in the legs in a way where the covers will fit back on. They will not click into place but should hold whilst you decide how to keep them on. I suppose even sticky-tape would work but hot glue is good at the edges so you can dissolve it in future if you need to.

As you can see, the change was successful and the tweezers boot.

I'm still testing the longevity of the charge/batteries as it's only just been 24hrs, but so far so good!

Now you ask where did I get batteries of the correct size and capacity?
After much research, I found these on AliExpress:

Looks like they did the trick, so I hope this helps someone else.
