Recently, I noticed that my Miniware/Morning Tools DT71 Test Tweezers were losing battery rather quickly after a full charge.
I did some testing and opened it up to test the batteries and BOY was it was the batteries!
There are two batteries, one in each leg.
One of them was swollen, so it's a good thing I found it.

There are a lot of instructions online about cutting a small piece of the leg out to reveal the battery terminals for soldering/desoldering.

However, before I tried this, I unscrewed the tip of the tweezers, popped the little piece of plastic off that aligns the legs upon closing and put a flat-bladed screwdriver there and successfully prised the inner cover off.

It seems to have caused the cover to become loose and perhaps it was glued and could be again perhaps using some hot glue that would dissolve with alcohol the next time (if there is one) that the batteries need replacing.
