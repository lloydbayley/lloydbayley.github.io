I thought I'd share some of my customisations that I do to my Macs to make life a little easier.
You may not like/use them all, or even any of them, however, they may come in handy for some!

## Tap To Click (Touch Pad)

I've found that being able to just tap the touchpad instead of pressing to click, is very handy.
If you didn't know about it, this is where to find it!

In Settings, scroll down on the left-hand menu, select Trackpad and you will see the screen below.
There, you can switch on Tap To Click

This is also the screen where you can set the secondary-click or "right-click" to tap/click with two fingers. Also, a handy thing. You cn find this directly above the Tap To Click option

## Dock Magnification

This is not for everyone but I've found that having magnifiction turned on for the dock at the bottom just gives a better indication of what app I'm about to click on. This is completely a personal preference and you will either love it or hate it.

In Settings, scroll down on the left-hand menu, select Desktop & Dock. On the right-hand pane, you will see Magnification at the top-right. You can play with the setting here.

## Quick Dictation "Hotkey"

In Settings, scroll down on the left-hand menu, select Keyboard. In the right-hand pane, scroll down until you see Dictation. Turn that on and then you can set the "hotkey" where it says "Shortcut". It's a nice feature to have when you get sick of typing etc. Double-Tap the Fn key and away you go! (You will need to be in a place where you can type at an insertion-point, of course.)
