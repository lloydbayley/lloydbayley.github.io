The best iOS and MacOS app for parcel tracking! Also for VisionOS.
<a href="https://parcelapp.net/" target="_blank">https://parcelapp.net</a>

I've been using this service for a while now and it's the best I've ever used.
So-far, I've only used it with Amazon and AliExpress. AliExpress mostly seems to use China Post and Cainiao and then a local carrier (in my case, Australia Post), whilst Amazon uses their own shippers.

This app even has an Amazon integration which keeps track of Amazon purchases automatically after you make them! All the way from International shipping to local delivery and will even change to the local carrier automatically if you set it to!

$5 a year if you want all the bells and whistles including push-notifications etc. 

I subscribed and love that there are no limitations and that it will alert me on my Mac, iPhone AND Apple Watch. This is very handy.

Apparently it even works on VisionOS apparently, although, I do not have anything with that on it.

I'm not being sponsored or getting any freebies for this, I just love it.
I've tried all sorts of other ones including 17Track and Aftership and they either need to be prodded to update or don't update at all or cause me other problems.

Here are the basic details but go to the website for all the info you need. (<a href="https://parcelapp.net/" target="_blank">https://parcelapp.net</a>)
