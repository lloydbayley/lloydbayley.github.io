This is a list of the software/services that I run in my homelab.
I have acquired these over a number of years and I use most of them on a daily (weekly) basis.
Most of the services are self-hosted in Virtual Machines in Proxmox, spread over a primary NUC, a secondary NUC and a development NUC. The FreePBX install has it's own, dedicated NUC.
They are in no particular order.
